# Stock-Streaming-PySpark
![Untitled design3](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dff0b5d3-9e46-4537-b35c-f8600c1f5419)

Created a pseudo real-time stock data processing and visualization application that seamlessly integrates Apache Kafka with PySpark and dynamic plotting tools. This application efficiently ingests stock price data from Kafka, processes it into OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) format, and aggregates it in one-minute intervals using PySpark's streaming capabilities. The pipeline ensures high performance with features like watermarking and checkpointing for reliable data handling. On the visualization side, a Python-based interface leverages confluent_kafka to stream processed data, dynamically generates candlestick charts using mplfinance, and provides real-time updates with matplotlib. The application excels in delivering live, interactive visualizations of stock data, complete with robust error handling and comprehensive logging. This project highlights advanced skills in real-time data processing, Kafka and Spark integration, and interactive data visualization, offering a compelling showcase of technical prowess and innovative solution development.
